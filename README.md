# Programming Challenge
The challenge is to complete a "Guess the Number" game. The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100, and you need to implement the logic to:
1. Check if the player's guess is correct
2. Give hints if the number is too high or too low
3. Keep track of the number of attempts
4. Display a fun message based on how many attempts were needed

## Running the script
```bash
python script.py
```
